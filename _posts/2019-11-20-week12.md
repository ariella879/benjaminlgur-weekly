## Wikipedia

When looking for possible contributions on Wikipedia one strategy I developed is looking for niche articles that may not have been updated recently. In my case I used small indie games, which was very good for me as usually they will be small enough that not that many people will have contributed to it, and because they are video games in development they would of likely received  updates that would not of been updated on their Wikipedia pages. Doing this my first contribution was a small edit where the word "the" was missing and then my further contributions focused on missing and outdated content.



### Election fraud: Is there an open source solution? Article

Having voting be software based is generally a problem anyway as you don't have any way to know what software is running on the machines even if it is claimed to be running open source software the code that is running can be switched. I wonder if the Trust The Vote Project is doing anything to be able to fix this problem or assure to the voters that the software on the machines is legitimate, perhaps some sort of authenticator and/or checksum system. However given that much of the voting that happens today is done using software it is imperative that we vote using open source software, and it ridiculous that we can not see what the software is as it means there is no accountability if the software is bad. It could be that one in every ten votes is being lost or changed but we would have no idea. In general I believe that the government should create/contract open source software and use open source software whenever possible with the obvious exceptions (the military, the CIA ect.) as the government is a public service anything that it produces should be made available to the public.
