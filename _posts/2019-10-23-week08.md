## Blog Week 8

### Project

The project I will work on is the [runelight project](https://github.com/runelite/runelite). I have already installed the development environment which is IntelliJ. I was able to build it with Maven. I appreciate that the project is very well documented as *almost* every function and class is well documented in the Javadocs. I have already read all the Javadocs, and much of the code itself. I have already made 2 pull requests mostly to learn the code base however because the project is quite large minimal/lazy pull requests are generally looked down upon by the community. So I am planing to make a more significant contribution so that it will be more likely merged in.

The fact that you can be potentially paid to work on contributing to a piece of open source software for your company is also very interesting.
