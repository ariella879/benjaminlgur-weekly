# Why I decided to take an open source software class.

 	>I grew up using quite a lot of open source software. This software such as VLC (in my opinion the greatest video player) and spent hours playing games on open source console emulators such as Dolphin and SNES9x. As well as software like Audacity, 7zip, Caliber, and FileZilla have a permeant place on my PC. I would be honored to give back to open source community and is one of the reasons I am interested in the open source software class. Secondly, I believe this class may be an excellent place to learn about practical software development so that I may implement it in my future career. Thatâ€™s why I am excited to take this class.
