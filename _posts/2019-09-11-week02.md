## First Open Source Contribution.

> 	My first open source contribution would probably just submitting issue tickets on GitHub since that just requires using the software, however from there I would very much like to work on writing some documentation on some open source software as much software has little and poor documentation and I think I can improve on this so that future contributors would have an easier time learning the code base and then be able to make contributions of their own. 

>    One of the open source projects that I am interested in working on is on mad packs/files for various video games as I am familiar with these projects and are not so big as some larger projects where contributions are less needed and room to expand the documentation/code is less.
